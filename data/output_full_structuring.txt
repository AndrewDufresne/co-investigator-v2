This Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is filed regarding James K. Morrison (Subject), a high-risk customer and real estate developer, and his related entity Morrison Development LLC. The report covers activity from September 1, 2024, to September 12, 2024, that exhibits patterns consistent with money laundering, specifically structuring cash deposits to avoid reporting requirements and layering funds through rapid transfers to shell companies in high-risk jurisdictions (Belize and Panama). The activity is inconsistent with the customer's stated expected business profile and is supported by internal communications indicating an intent to conceal.

**Executive Summary: Layering and Structuring Scheme**
The Subject's activity demonstrates a coordinated scheme to introduce, layer, and place funds. The scheme began with structured cash deposits into multiple accounts, followed by rapid consolidation of funds into a business account, and culminated in large outgoing international wires to entities in jurisdictions known for financial opacity. This pattern is indicative of layering, a stage of money laundering designed to obscure the origin of funds.

**Transaction Pattern Analysis: Structuring Below CTR Thresholds**
Between September 1 and September 10, 2024, the Subject made five separate cash deposits at different branch locations, each just below the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold, totaling $48,500. The deposits were: $9,800 (TXN-20240901-001) and $9,700 (TXN-20240902-001) into checking account ACC-001-CHK; $9,500 (TXN-20240901-002) into savings account ACC-002-SAV; $9,900 (TXN-20240905-001) into business account ACC-003-BIZ; and $9,600 (TXN-20240910-001) into ACC-001-CHK. This pattern triggered a high-severity structuring alert (ALT-2024-0912).

**Fund Movement and Layering**
Following the cash deposits, funds were rapidly moved. On September 5, a $45,000 internal transfer (TXN-20240905-002) moved funds from the savings account (ACC-002-SAV) to the business account (ACC-003-BIZ). Subsequently, two large international wires were sent from the pooled funds. On September 3, a $28,500 wire (TXN-20240903-001) was sent from ACC-001-CHK to Pacific Holdings Ltd in Belize (BZ), described as a "Consulting fee." On September 7, a $52,000 wire (TXN-20240907-001) was sent from ACC-003-BIZ to Coral Bay Investments SA in Panama (PA), described as a "Property acquisition deposit." A final $18,000 wire (TXN-20240912-001) was sent to Pacific Holdings Ltd on September 12. The rapid movement of funds through multiple accounts prior to international disbursement is a hallmark of layering.

**Jurisdictional Risk: Links to PA and BZ Shell Companies**
The wire beneficiaries are entities in jurisdictions monitored by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Pacific Holdings Ltd is registered in Belize (BZ), a FATF Grey List jurisdiction, with minimal public filings and no verifiable business operations. Coral Bay Investments SA is registered in Panama (PA), also a FATF-monitored jurisdiction and known tax haven, with an opaque ownership structure. External intelligence confirms both entities exhibit characteristics of shell companies. These wires triggered a high-risk jurisdiction alert (ALT-2024-0913).

**Behavioral Anomalies: KYC Mismatch and Suspicious Communications**
The Subject's actual activity profile of "frequent_cash_deposits_with_international_wires" starkly contradicts the expected activity declared during KYC of "monthly_business_transfers_10k_50k," constituting a significant KYC mismatch. Furthermore, flagged internal communications reveal intent to conceal. A secure message on September 4, 2024, stated: "Need to split the remaining into smaller deposits. Keep it under the radar. Will come to different branches this week." An email on September 6 instructed: "Send the wire to Panama ASAP. Don't include any details in the memo field. Just use 'consulting' as the description." These communications directly correlate with the observed structuring and wire activity.

**Supporting Risk Indicators**
Additional factors supporting the suspicion include: 1) An adverse media hit from November 2023 noting Morrison Development LLC was under investigation for undisclosed offshore property holdings; 2) The Subject maintains a high-risk rating; 3) Transaction descriptions for high-value wires are generic (e.g., "Consulting fee," "Advisory services"), potentially serving as coded communication.

Based on the totality of circumstances, the financial activity of James K. Morrison is highly suspicious and indicative of money laundering. The combination of structured cash deposits, rapid layering of funds through multiple accounts, subsequent transmission of funds to high-risk jurisdiction shell companies, explicit instructions to conceal activity in internal communications, and a clear mismatch with the customer's stated profile provides a reasonable basis for filing this SAR. The patterns observed are consistent with efforts to avoid regulatory reporting, obscure the source and destination of funds, and integrate illicit proceeds into the financial system. It is recommended that this activity be investigated for potential violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, including structuring and money laundering.

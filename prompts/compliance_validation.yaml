  2. accuracy: Facts consistent with source data? Any hallucinated details?
  3. coherence: Logically structured and easy to follow?
  4. regulatory_alignment: Meets FinCEN narrative requirements?
  5. evidence_citation: Specific transactions, dates, amounts referenced?
  6. objectivity: Factual, non-speculative language? No tipping off?
  7. actionability: Useful for law enforcement?
